# Temperature-Prediction-CNN

This repository contains the files for the project - Temperature prediction using Deep Learning. Tradionally, we use an LSTM or Bi-LSTM for time series data to make accurate predictions. As an alternative approach, we decided to convert time series data to images using Gramian Angular Field concepts. We were then able to create a convolutional neural network to then predict the temperature for the city of Delhi. The model was able to learn all the patterns associated with time series data and gave an rmse of
